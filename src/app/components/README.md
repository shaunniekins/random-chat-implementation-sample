Supabase is a great tool for building real-time applications, but it doesn't inherently support the concept of "pairing" users for a 1-on-1 chat. However, you can design a system using Supabase's real-time capabilities to achieve this.

Here's a high-level idea of how you could implement this:

1. User Queue: Create a table in Supabase to act as a queue. When a user wants to chat, they add a record to this table.

2. Pairing Users: Create a serverless function (like a Google Cloud Function, AWS Lambda, or Vercel Serverless Function) that listens for changes to the queue table. When a new record is added, it checks if there's another user in the queue. If there is, it pairs the two users together by creating a new chat session record in another table and removes the users from the queue.

3. Chat Session: The chat session record contains the IDs of the two users and a unique session ID. Each message in the chat also gets stored in a table with the session ID.

4. Real-time Updates: Use Supabase's real-time subscriptions to listen for new messages in the chat session on the client side. When a new message is added to the chat, it's automatically pushed to both users.

5. Sending Messages: When a user sends a message, it's added to the chat messages table with the session ID. Because the client is listening for new messages, it will automatically update.

This approach requires some server-side logic to handle the user pairing, but it allows you to build a 1-on-1 chat system using Supabase. Please note that this is a high-level overview and you'll need to handle things like error checking, user disconnections, and more.
